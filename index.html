					<p> Our story began in January of 2014 when a California girl came to study in the small country of Lithuania. We shared two of the same classes and a group project, where we got to talk and listen to each others ideas. With so many shared similarities, this led to a quick and natural friendship. Little did either of us know that this friendship would lead us on adventures across the world: from volunteering in Hawaii to camping in Utah and California. I guess you could say the "friend zone" didn't really suit us, and before we knew it our friendship gave way to love. Fast forward two years (2016), and we are now engaged, and looking forward to a lifetime more of adventures. </p>
